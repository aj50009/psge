PSGE (Playstation Game Engine)

This project is incomplete. It was supposed to be a simple 2D game engine written for the Sony Playstation 1. Currently it supports reading disc files, reading and writing to memory card(s) and controller checking. Testing was done using NO$PSX debugger.

To compile, you require PSYQ toolkit alongside some unofficial tools.
They can be found on the PSXDEV.net forum.
